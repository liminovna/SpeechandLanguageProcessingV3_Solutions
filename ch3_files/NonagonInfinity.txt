My body's overworked
It's just the same I know
When can my body work
Cold static overload?
My body works, I know
It's just the same, I know
My only difference
Is robot influence

I'm up here for the weirdo swarm
I'm the door when you come for more

I'm the drudge that goes again and again
Bring the spooks to the beer-soaked glade
The robots here of the robots paid

Pearly guillotine

Milk and honey for my body
C'mon through the door, see
It's your unborn self
(Seen it before)
Fake soul-butter
Made of rubber
Stick it in the skin, see
It's a wealth of life!
Gamma knife!

Gamma knife

Crack the whip

Cut the skin
And bend the truth

All I wanted was my youth
(Gamma!)
All in favor of this truth

People-vultures
God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures waiting to begin
Deadly ulcers feeding on my skin

People-vultures waiting by my stage
Wild dogs escaping from their cage

People-vultures
God approaches
Final hearing
What else have I got left to spew down?

People-vultures
God approaches
Final hearing
Disappearing
Tainted voodoo
Headless guru
Final head-spin

Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat

Latent gun beamed for my head
It's a wonder that I tread
Over worn ground through my youth
Making all my dreams come true

Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat

Happy days seem so absurd
Lightning that's unlikely heard
Nova sunshine while I nap
Making all my dreams so sad

Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat

Don't miss the bar, we play here
Already ringing in my ears
Don't miss the bar, it's right here
Only a beat disappears

Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat, only miss a beat
Once I'm Mr. Beat I only miss a beat

You started everything
You started killing things
You started severing limbs

Evil death roll
Now

You float and wait for me
Your scales are hard and green
Open your jaw for me

Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll
Now

The night is young - full of sin
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife

So let's start dueling here
I have nothing to fear
I'm grinning ear to ear

Evil death roll
Now
Evil death roll
Now

The night is young - full of pain
Time to slither away again
I can see our history hanging on a knife
So let's start killing things

You distort the notion of the place
The universe's other face
The speed of light has slowed apace
The universe's other face

What it is
Impossible
Gravity
The universe
Has me
Invisible face

Wah wah wah wah...

I can feel the earth is moving
Underneath my hoofed foots earthing
Fire protrudes from whence I'm pointing
Fading every jewel
Thronged upon the rock and metal
There's a horde inside this temple
Mass around your favorite devil
Learn to make them cry

Wah wah wah wah...

See him hover way up high
He is the bat with 16 eyes
He has a thirst to satisfy
A craving for your blood
Now here come the wolves with whips
And 40 goats with pitchfork sticks
And look there is a lunatic
He wants to make you cry

Wah wah wah wah...

I'm the chieftain of your feelings
I'm the God of air you're breathing
You can not escape my dealing
I will make you cry 

The spawn of Satan's back
It's made of steel and black
It comes to bring you pain
It comes again and again

Road Train!

The spawn of Satan's here
It's come to bring you fear
It sets the road aflame
It comes to kill and maim

Road Train!

Lights that shine like bulging eyes
Keep on trucking through the night
The vortex opens through
Drive right in and straight through you

The spawn of Satan comes
It's carting oil drums
It's racing down the lane
With oily fiery rain

Road Train!

26 gears of petrol power
Keep on trucking hour by hour
One man is at the wheel
He's the dog at Satan's heel

Across the desert to the trees
Obliteration of the place
From the fire into the sea
Nonagon Infinity
Is coming!

The spawn of Satan speeds
The road beneath it bleeds
It comes to bring you shame
It comes again and again

Road Train!

Burning wheels of fiery red
Keep on trucking till we're dead
The beast is angry too
Drive real fast and eat up you

Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Nonagon infinity
Is coming!
