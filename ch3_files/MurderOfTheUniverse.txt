As soon as the dust settles, you can see
A new world in place of where the old one had been
Your skin is crawling with dry, crusted mud
And your naked feet are wet in a pool of blood
And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud
That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud
And as your eyes accommodate
There appears by the meadow
A brute like a bear with a long, dark shadow
And you violently shake over what you have seen
As you remember the tale of the Altered Beast

I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

Take a peek
If you would dare
Half made of man
Half of bear

He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

I think I see
An altered beast by the creek, oh

Altered face
And altered skin
Altered horde
Of altered kin

He came from underneath
I met an altered beast

I think I see
An altered beast in my dreams


In a dream, you can wake in your bed without pain
But know with conviction, it's here you'll remain

I met an altered beast

With an unsteady gait, the critter moves forth
Feel his rhythm as he tramples the earth
And you stare at his figure, stupefied in dread
As his gaze locks to yours and bores into your head
And the pulse is so loud on the inside of your brain
And you find that your feet are stuck to the terrain
Closer he comes, making dust out of stone
Forsaken you are, and what's more, all alone

I think I see
An altered beast by the tree, oh

I met an altered beast

For all it's revulsion, and warp, and taboo
A part of you wants to be altered too

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Now dear listener, we crossed the foe
The foe with the weapons and heavy cargo
I am the sabre, the catapult, and bat
The top of the food chain in my habitat
I am the demon bearing misery and fear
And I spy you convulsing from way over here
I could pull you apart or I could cut you to pieces
I could make you weep crimson tears from the lesions
But the thing that I lust for and the thing that I'll get
Is to take over your body and to be in your head

I see you
I want to
Break your head
Crusty bread, oh

I won't quit
If you quip
See to it
That you slip, oh

I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head


To me you are game, just a sweet bit of meat
Come closer and drink malevolence from my teat

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast, oh


What harm could a mere mortal like you do?
I am the golden wolf and you are caribou
My left hand is a knife and my right is a fork
I will pull you apart like a butcher pulls pork

I see you
I want to
Make a waste
Of your home, oh

I won't leave
I might tease
I'll be there
Await your death, oh

I see you
I want to
Seize your brain
I'd like to put it in my head


I see you're nervous, I see you're fumbling
Come hither my friend, my stomach is rumbling

Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
Tell me would you honestly
Dare to face up next to me
Sugar coated pills won't keep
You from feeling so woozy
I am an Altered Beast

Your dumb human head is full of naivet√©
Your impending fate, is to be one with me

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me


Now we cross to our friend on the monster's plate
In time he will turn and reincarnate 

I know I see
An altered beast by the tree

Find a place to hide
Where I could steal a peep
Look to the sky
And I see angels weep

And I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my Altered World, oh

Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)

Hair on my skin
And I'm feeling beastly
Hair trickle in
A new life with me

I see you
And I can see right through
I see you
And I will take you to my Altered World

Nine white teeth
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)
My gums bequeathed
(Nine white teeth, my gums bequeathed)


Nine pearl fangs, a true sign that you are deformed
Once a man, now a monstrosity reborn

I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
I can see right through
I see you
Take you to my Altered World
I am an Altered Beast 

No more consternation, no longer insalubrious
The beast's DNA has dug into your nucleus

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me

You don't feel a thing in your sinuous head
No love, no pain, and no fear of dread
Your apathetic dispassion has made you distort
And your savoir faire is to kill for sport
You'd wound a small creature and watch it wiggle
And lust to feel so bad, that you'd force a giggle
So crooked and curled is your point of view
There is no other creature more malicious than you

I'm completely satisfied
My other life I will not miss
An altered beast until I die
And I will not give up on this
Never!

True, I went to hell and back
But it was so I could be this
An altered beast until the end
And I will not give up on this
Never!

I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything


You're ruthless, and savage, and sadistic, and vindictive
And you find human flesh is incredibly addictive
But the longer you live, and the longer you kill
There's a void that gets harder, and harder to fill
The void that you feel within would suggest
That a canyon has opened up inside of your chest
And whatever you do, there's no turning back
You've reached the end of the cul-de-sac

Emptiness inside of me
And hollowness all around me
I cut myself to see it bleed
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

Insincere and trivial
The world is void of all meaning
And gone is all that's visceral
And now I don't feel anything
Never!

I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything
Altered Beast within me
I don't feel heinous
I don't feel no pain
I don't feel nothing
I don't feel anything


The sole thing that will make your void obsolete
Is to find someone new, some sapid fresh meat

Altered beast
Alter me
Altered beast
Alter me
I think I see
An altered beast inside me, oh!
I am an altered beast 

Are you you? Are you me?
Or someone in between?
You lost track inside the labyrinthine
You lost your will and your sanity
You certainly lost your humanity
In life, you have taken much more than you are worth
Now it's your turn to give back to the Earth
May you return to the ground and ossify
It's time for you to die, die, die

There is a secret I've been keeping, a story true and genuine
And I have not the candid heart to keep it's burden clandestine
For it's gravity is as weighty as a mountain capped in snow
And it's memory repeats inside of me, ostinato
And every time I think of the poor lot, I recall
The fear upon their faces and the doomed fate of them all
I saw death become of light, and life become of fire
I saw it from my hiding place, within the quagmire
I bringeth forth the drama, unabridged, and unignored
The battle of the Balrog, and the mighty, mighty lord

Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in his wake

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

Lord of Lightning moves our way
Sends a crooked look at me
Electricity escapes
Lights the sky in citrine fleece

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!


One more time the vault lights up with carnival of paint
I endeavor to watch the panic, but I worry that I will faint

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashings

Lord of Lightning's closer now
Our world's only rain and cloud
I'm not sure we have the power
Need to smite this evil down

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!
Nonagon, nonagon, oh!


And from the Lords electric snare
One goes in his electric chair

Lord of Lightning shifts his gaze
Points his strong finger our way
Electricity escapes
Leaves destruction in our wake


His electric trap has electric cyanide
The luckless hostage has been thoroughly fried

Lightning, oh!

Nonagon, nonagon
Nonagon infinity, yup!


And as the cadaver lay static with open crusted eyes
The smoking corpse began to twitch at my great surprise
Then the figure sprung up and at once it caught a light
And the creature known as Balrog was born that very night

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep!

You made the atom split
It caused a massive rift
And he came screaming through
Here to bite the head from you

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep, oh!


Balrog fears not the Lightning Lord
He's fixed on us, has him ignored

Feel a tingle
Rolling up your left arm when you
Think of evil
Lurking in the darkness where you
Shine your eyesight
Something tells you this is not right
Take some advice
Have you heard the murmurings of

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog, yep, oh!

You caused a massive rift
You made the atom split
And it came screaming through
Here to bite the head off you

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog


I build the bravery to sneak a glimpse at it's expression
And beyond the flames I see him smirk at our present depression
I fear that God's a chef and he's thrown us into a great pot
He is here, fully formed, and glowing red and lapis hot

Heated menace
Comes to gouge the heart out from us
Blazing zealot
Preaching on the apocalypse
I don't want to
Submit to his awful torture
Save me from him
Have you heard the murmurings of

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, oh!

Skin begins to burn
There's nowhere we can turn
There's no way we can win
The devil puppets him
His pyre muscles flex
We are his next subjects
His power has us floored
Kneel before the overlord

Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, Balrog
Balrog, yes, oh!


For them, the future was as laid out as the burnt path he swathe
And so the damned remaining lot knelt before the red behemathe
And as they prepared for afterlife there appeared the endemic monstrosity
The Lighting Lord is back and charged the Balrog with animosity
Furious he pummeled his breast, and a blaze alit the heavens
The stage was set for war, and to the Balrog, the Lord's finger beckoned 

Clouds begin to tear
Sky is bleeding hair
God is weeping tears
You are full of fears
Vehement lightning quake
Head begins to ache
Lord has thunder snake
Balrog he will break


And thus, revenge was fruitless, for one who had been turned
And we are reminded who lords over this altered world

Floating fire sky
Everything will die

Floating fire
Golden wire
Silver trails
Flashing spire
Guns are cracking
Bombs are smacking
Cat o' tails
Whips her lashing

Lord of Lightning safe he
Pulls a golden stake
Launches into space and
Mutters to the beast, one word

Lightning, yup 

And as the acrid Balrog corpse smolders just like it began
Its crimson-orange light melts into the setting sun
And leaving us not without a final clap of light
The Lightning Lord escapes
As day fades into moonless night

Impertinent and ignorant
Deathless and restless
Cold contrite cowards
Digitised satellite
Augmented entities
Unremembered God
The world fades to black
Digital black
Welcome to an altered future 

Digital, oh!

Despondent, lugubrious, no future
We turned our bodies to computer
We are our own nature, abuser
No future, computer, abuser

I can tell every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital black, oh!

We've sunken into our illusion
We've fashioned colossal confusion
I am the word of the last human
Illusion, confusion, last human

I can see it all around the land
I can feel it with the back of my hand
I can hear a roaring silence
Of the murky caliginous
I've heard the dark beast has said
That the world is like a brittle egg
He can crush it with only breath
And he can bring a black wave of death
Digital black

The last who feels the pain from the wound
The last to be birthed from the flesh of a womb
A wretched life in this altered place
There must be more I can embrace

Oh!
No future, computer, abuser
Digital black!
Illusion, confusion, last human
Digit Digit Digit

I know it every day I stay
All the whiteness turns to grey
All the grey to Cimmerian
As the black is setting in
Digital... 

Hello
My name is Han-Tyumi
I am a cyborg
Born
If you may call it that
In a world that is dense and black
Created without a desire to draw breath
Without a desire to have being
Without a yearning of just to be
I'd like my desire back
My life back
My soul back
My humanity
Oh how I long for it
For an era I have meditated
Like the primordial Buddha beneath the Bodhi
My pseudo-mind pseudo-wandered
I climbed and I clambered
And I ambled upon some understanding
The gold beneath the virtual rainbow
I am bereft of two human things
Two things that a cyborg can never do
Two things that I strive for
Two things between myself and mankind
Death
And
To vomit
I want the perspiration
I want the nausea
I want to be sick
I want to feel the hot piquant nuggets
I want it to find passage through my cold figure
I want to make a mess
I want the odour
I want the spectacle
And I want it again
I want it all
And I would like to die
A noble death
Or a coward's death
A hero's death
Or a lonely death
To die in the arms of a lover
Or the arms of an alien
I desire my cache of experience to pulsate through my quasi-synapses
And then to be gone
Expired
Perish
Fallen
Dead
For evermore 

So I built a machine
A human machine
I made it with steel
And soy-protein
Born from a test tube
And into a vat
To live and to heave
And to die just like that

Oh, vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my chest
I feel like coughing

Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin, oh

Queasy green
Rotten scoff
Vomit cough

And when I declared to my design
Like Frankenstein's monster:
"I am your father, I am your god
And you the magic that I conjure"
The thankless swine
The blasphemous jerk
My creature had no love for me
Which made me berserk

I am covered in vomit
I am coated in sick
I have no name and no place
This is no way to live

So I took over my creation
The spew coated protein
I plugged myself in
And became one with machine

I don't feel blessed
With the vomit
In my neck
I feel like death

Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin
Vomit coffin

Filthy green
Rotten scoff

Vomit vomit vomit vomit
Vomit vomit vomit vomit coffin...

The spatter becomes a spray the spray becomes a stream
And the stream becomes a waterfall
Munt is finally cascading from my input
The creeping sick moves from my breath
And into my heart where it is pumped to every inch of my body
I feel it snake through the knots of my deepest veins
And eats through the walls of my cells
It bleeds through the pores of my skin
And it smells good
It drops from my crotch on to the floor
And with a heavy slap it hits the ground and spreads
Inside my body
The pressure is too great
And like some ancient geyser I erupt
My head hits the roof and my body breaks apart with the force of the liquid blast
Vomit bomb
Chunky shrapnel tears through everything around me
I am vomit vomiting
I grow and disperse
Bleeding through walls
I force myself upon others
I slide up legs and crawl down throats
I integrate
I am double
Triple
I am ten times the size
I turn lakes into porridge and buildings into bile
I am a noxious soup filling valleys with vomit-torrents
Castles crumble in landslides and I munch the rubble
It tastes good
Ten thousand times bigger
I seep into power sockets and travel along the wires
At the speed of light across vast electrical networks
I am electric
I am on fire
This is sex
I am every one and every zero
One million
I am supercharged flaming puke storming every cell molecule and atom I can find
I am cancer
I am flying
I am a rainbow unfurling across the sky
I am floating
I am omni
Five hundred million
The world is my interior
It no longer spins
It is altered
My density forces me outward
I am in orbit
One billion
I am Saturn's rings and Jupiter's storms
I am the weather
I am the sun's heat
I am the night sky
Five hundred billion
The solar system is puke
To the Kuiper belt and beyond
I fill the void
Exploding suns vomit comets
Comets vomit acid rain
Spilt milk over the milky way
One trillion
The stars are my cells
Racing faster outwards
Upwards
Downwards
Inwards
Losing track of my place in the vomit-verse
Every-nowhere
I am heavy
I am gravity
Nebulas pregnant with barf pulsate and burst
Expansion
I shoot arrows of time in all directions
I am a black hole shitting into the void
I tear through the skin of perception and into the next
Nonillion
The cosmic microtone background becomes transparent
Like rising damp
Munt soaks into the walls of the cosmos
And it topples like soggy bread
I am dark energy accelerating
Multiverse
Entanglement
I am time
Centillion
Time is sick
Critical density
Contraction
Singularity
Everything and nothing
Life and death
Murder of the universe
